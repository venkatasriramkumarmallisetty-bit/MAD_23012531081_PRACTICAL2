Android Activity Lifecycle Demonstration

This project is a simple Android application created to demonstrate the fundamental lifecycle of an Android Activity and display a basic UI screen.


AIM
The main goal of this application is to showcase the different states of an Activity's lifecycle. It does this by displaying log messages, toasts, and snackbars for each lifecycle callback method (onCreate, onStart, onResume, onPause, onStop, onRestart, and onDestroy).

The secondary goal is to create a basic user interface with a styled TextView centered on the screen.

UI Requirements:
Activity Background: Yellow (#FFFF00)
TextView:
Text: "Hello World!"
Text Color: Holo Blue Bright (@android:color/holo_blue_bright)
Text Size: 27sp
Text Style: Bold and Italic
Core Concepts Demonstrated
This project provides a practical study of several fundamental Android concepts:

Activity Lifecycle: The core focus of the project. It demonstrates the sequence of states an Activity goes through from when it is first created until it is destroyed.
UI Notifications:
Log Message: Used to print information to the Logcat window for debugging.
Toast Message: A small pop-up message that appears on the screen for a short duration.
Snackbar Message: A modern alternative to a Toast, which appears at the bottom of the screen.
Basic UI Design:
TextView: A standard UI widget used to display text with various style properties.
ConstraintLayout: A flexible layout manager used here to center the TextView.
In-built Android Resources: The project uses a pre-defined Android color (@android:color/holo_blue_bright).
Lifecycle Output Demonstration
The application provides real-time feedback for each lifecycle event using three different methods simultaneously.

1. Logcat Output
For every lifecycle event, a message is printed to Logcat. You can filter by the tag ActivityLifeCycle to see a clean sequence of events as you interact with the app.

2. Snackbar and Toast Message Output
A Toast and a Snackbar message are displayed on the screen for each lifecycle event, providing immediate visual feedback directly within the app's UI.
